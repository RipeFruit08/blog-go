After a several days of procrastinating, I finally secured this blog with HTTPS
using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/pages/about). I had done this task once
before sometime back in 2020 and remember it being a really confusing process. I
was pleasantly surprised to find that this time around it was fairly
straightforward and I actually understood what I was doing! The [Digital Ocean
tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-22-04)
I followed was really helpful, and I later found that certbot's own website had
a really convenient [tool](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions) that will help
you get up and running on a number of different platforms!
